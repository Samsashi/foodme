Fix applied for the error encountered while running the web-server.bat

Issue due to express module showing following error:
      throw new Error('Most middleware (like ' + name + ') is no longer bundled
with Express and must be installed separately. Please see https://github.com/sen
chalabs/connect#middleware.');

Resolution by re-installing the express:
npm install express@">=3.0.0 <4.0.0" --save
